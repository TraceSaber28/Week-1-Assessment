// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step in which the requirements to complete the application or website or whatever the project may be  and get them approved for the intended audience"
const design = "This is the third step where we begin brainstorming and submitting potential designs for how to code the problem, the best design is chosen based on time requirements, budget, risk assessment etc..."
const implementation = "This is the fourth stage in which the development of the product begins following the guidelines of the design, depending on how detailed the design was the code generation goes very smoothly"
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth stage, testing happens constanly throughout the development process however this type of testing is when the product is 'finished' and tests for bugs and problems until it meets the standards of the design"
const maintain = "The final stage is to update and maintain the product based on repotrted bugs and feedback  from the customers"
